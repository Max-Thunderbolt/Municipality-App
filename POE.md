Referencing Rubric
Providing evidence based on valid and referenced academic sources is a
fundamental educaƟonal principle and the cornerstone of high-quality
academic work. Part of achieving this quality is referencing in a way that is
consistent and congruent with the requirements of the referencing style being
used.

Therefore, inconsistent and/or incongruent referencing will result in a penalty
of a maximum of ten percent being deducted from the overall percentage
awarded to your assessment submission.

Please note that evidence of plagiarism in the form of copied or unreferenced
work, absent reference lists, or excepƟonally poor referencing may result in
acƟon being taken in accordance with The IIE’s Intellectual Integrity and
Property Rights Policy (IIE023). Similarly, evidence of excessive AI usage may
result in acƟon being taken in accordance with The IIE’s Student Conduct,
Discipline and Safety Policy (IIE015).

```
Markers are required to provide feedback to students by circling/underlining
the informaƟon in the table below that best describes the student’s work
and by adding construcƟve commentary where appropriate. The examples
provided are not exhausƟve but illustrate the errors.
DeducƟons
 Where the student’s work contains five or more errors aligned to the
minor errors column below, deduct 5% from the overall percentage.
 Where the student’s work contains five or more errors aligned to the
major errors column below, deduct 10% from the overall percentage.
 Where both minor and major errors (e.g. two minor and three major,
etc.) are present, deduct 10% only (and not 5% or 15%) from the overall
percentage.
Required:
Consistent and congruent
referencing
```

```
Minor errors
Deduct 5% from overall percentage.
Example: if the response receives 70%, deduct 5%. The
final mark is 65%.
```

```
Major errors
Deduct 10% from the overall percentage.
Example: if the response receives 70%, deduct 10%.
The final mark is 60%.
Consistency
The correct referencing style for
the discipline – i.e., either
Harvard, OR APA (for
Psychology), OR Law, OR IEEE
(for ICT/Engineering) – has
been used consistently for all
in-text references and in the
bibliography/reference list.
Concepts and ideas that are
quoted and/or paraphrased
are referenced consistently
throughout.
Position of the in-text reference:
an in-text reference is
positioned consistently where
appropriate for every quote and paraphrase.
```

```
Minor inconsistencies:
 The referencing style used is generally consistent with
what is required, but there are one or two
changes/errors in the format of in-text referencing
and/or in the bibliography/reference list.
 For example, page numbers for direct quotes in-text
have been provided for one source, but not in another.
Or, two book chapters in the bibliography/reference
list have been referenced in two different formats. Or,
the publication year has been placed after the author
name in one bibliography/reference list entry, and
after the source title in another, etc.
 Concepts and ideas in quotes and/or paraphrases are
typically referenced, but a full in-text reference is
missing or incomplete from one or two small sections of the work.
```

```
 Position of the references: in-text references are only
given at the beginning and/or end of every paragraph.
```

```
Major inconsistencies:
 Poor and wholly inconsistent referencing style used
in-text and/or in the bibliography/reference list.
 Multiple referencing styles for the same source
types have been used.
 For example, the format for direct quotes in-text
and/or book chapters in the bibliography/reference
list and/or year of publication in the
bibliography/reference list is different across
multiple instances.
 Concepts and ideas in quotes and/or paraphrases
are haphazardly referenced in-text.
 Position of the references: in-text references are
only given at the beginning or end of large sections
of work.
```

```
Feedback on referencing consistency:
```

```
Congruency
 Each source reflected within
in-text references is included
accurately in the bibliography/reference list.
```

```
 All bibliography/reference list
entries are in the required
order for the referencing style
used (e.g. alphabetical,
alphabetical under
subheadings, numerical).
 All direct quotes and
paraphrases have been
integrated appropriately into
the text using introductory
phrases, accurate grammar,
etc.
```

```
Minor incongruences:
 There is largely a match between the sources
presented in-text and those in the
bibliography/reference list, but one or two sources that appear in-text do not appear in the
bibliography/reference list, or vice versa. Or key source
information is missing from one or two in-text
references or bibliography/reference list entries only
(e.g. publication year, city of publication, URL date
accessed, etc.).
 There is a clear and largely accurate ordering of
sources in the bibliography/reference list as required
by the referencing style used, but with one or two
references out of order.
 An attempt has been made for source integration into
the text using appropriate introductory phrases and
grammar, but one or two quotes or paraphrases do
not flow as clearly or logically within the sentence
structure as they could.
```

```
Major incongruences:
 No relationship/several incongruencies between
the in-text referencing and the
bibliography/reference list.
 For example, multiple sources are included in-text,
but not in the bibliography, and/or vice versa. Key
source information is missing from multiple in-text
references and/or reference list entries. A URL link,
rather than the actual reference, is provided in the
bibliography. Sources are repeated in the reference
list, etc.
 Most sources are listed in a haphazard order
throughout the bibliography/reference list.
 Few to no appropriate introductory phrases or
rules of grammar have been applied, and many
direct quotes and/or paraphrases feel disconnected
from the flow of the text.
